## Requirements
* php >=7.4
* phpbb >= 3.2

## Important notes

* Installing of [Simple mentions phpBB extension](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/simple_mentions/) strongly suggested.  
  [@mention]() feature makes it really easy to talk to AI bots and other board users.  
  👉 I created a small update for version 2.0 to support notifications when editing an already submitted post. Simply replace your `/ext/paul999/mention/event/main_listener.php` with the provided [main_listener.php](../privet/ailabs/docs/main_listener.php) to enable this feature.

* If you are planning to use image generation AI (eg DALL-E or Stable Diffusion) make sure to adjust attachment settings to support large images and verify that `webp` image extension configured.  

  Go to `ACP` > `General` > `Attachment settings` and adjust `Total attachment quota`, `Maximum file size` and `Maximum file size messaging`:
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/attachment_settings.png)  

  Go to `ACP` > `Posting` > `Manage attachment extensions`, look for `webp`, add it if missing:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/attachment_webp.png)  

  Above does not apply to Discord AI bots (eg Midjourney), as all generated images are actually stored on your Discord account and served via the [Discord CDN smart proxy](#discord-cdn-smart-proxy-setup).

* If you have extensions installed that require users to log in, such as [Login Required](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/login_required) you will need to whitelist `/ailabs/*` and `/app.php/ailabs/*` since AI Labs extension uses callbacks.

* Adjust [PHP configuration](https://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php) to allow longer script execution. ChatGPT API responses may take up to 90 seconds to respond in certain cases. If you have the default settings, your SQL connection will be closed after 30 seconds, preventing the extension from functioning properly.  
  Suggested values for `php.ini`:  
  > max_execution_time = 180  
  > max_input_time = 90  

## Installation

Download https://github.com/privet-fun/phpbb_ailabs and copy `/privet/ailabs` to `phppp/ext` folder:  
![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/ext_location.png) 

**IMPORTANT**  
If you have a previous version of this extension installed, you will need to disable it and then enable it again after the new version has been copied over.  
Do not forget to purge the cache after the new version has been installed.   

Go to `ACP` > `Customise` > `Manage extensions` and enable the `AI Labs` extension.

Finally go to `ACP` > `Extensions` > `AI Labs` > `Settings` and add desired AI configurations:  
![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/ailabs_settings.png) 

## BBCode `mp3` tag

The following AI bots are generating `mp3` audio and will require adding the `[mp3]` BBCode tag:  
* [Mureka](#mureka-setup)

To add `mp3` BBCode tag, go to `ACP` > `POSTING` > `BBCodes` and add `mp3` tag as shown below:  
  ![BBCode tag](../privet/ailabs/docs/bbcode_mp3.png)   
  **BBCode usage**: 
  ```text
  [mp3]{URL}[/mp3]
  ```
  **HTML replacement**: 
  ```text
  <audio controls>
  <source src="{URL}" type="audio/mp3">Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
  ```
  **Help line**:
  ```text
  [mp3]http://example.com/music.mp3[/mp3]
  ```

## BBCode `mp4` tag

The following Discord AI bots are generating `mp4` videos and will require adding the `[mp4]` BBCode tag:  
* [Pika](#pika-setup)

To add `mp4` BBCode tag, go to `ACP` > `POSTING` > `BBCodes` and add `mp4` tag as shown below:  
  ![BBCode tag](../privet/ailabs/docs/bbcode_mp4.png)   
  **BBCode usage**: 
  ```text
  [mp4]{URL}[/mp4]
  ```
  **HTML replacement**: 
  ```text
  <video src="{URL}" style="width:100%;max-width:640px" controls>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
  ```
  You can adjust above `max-width:NNNpx` to desired value.  
  **Help line**:
  ```text
  [mp4]http://example.com/video.mp4[/mp4]
  ```

## Discord CDN smart proxy setup

Discord CDN attachments have an expiration time, as seen in this [original announcement screenshot](https://privet.fun/download/file.php?id=21760).
To allow users to access media generated by Discord AI bots you need to set up a Discord CDN smart proxy.

Currently following Discord AI bots supported by this plugin via API provided by [useapi.net](https://useapi.net):
* [Midjourney](#midjourney-setup)
* [FaceSwap](#faceswap-setup)
* [Pika](#pika-setup)

You will need at least one Discord token(s) from any of above Discord AI bots. In fact, you can use any Discord account to obtain a token since Discord does not check or enforce any security validations. All you need is an active Discord account and a Discord token for that account - see how to  [obtain Discord token](https://useapi.net/docs/start-here/setup-midjourney#obtain-discord-token). You may configure multiple Discord tokens to spread the load and avoid Discord 429 response codes. However, this is a theoretical safety measure as I have yet to encounter a 429 response for this particular use case, even with a single Discord account. It appears that Discord does not throttle attachment refresh API calls at this point.

Discord attachments use one of the following formats:
* https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/`channel`/`message`/`attachment_file_name`.`file_ext`?ex=`expire_date`&is=`issued_on`&hm=`check_sum`
* https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/`channel`/`message`/`attachment_file_name`.`file_ext`?ex=`expire_date`&is=`issued_on`&hm=`check_sum`

Where `expire_date` and `issued_on` values are unix/epoch hex timestamps, here's [convertor](https://www.epochconverter.io/hex-timestamp-converter) to human-readable format.  

All Discord AI bots provided by this extension will convert the original attachment links as follows:
* `your_website_root_url`/ailabs/discord_cdn/cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/`channel`/`message`/`attachment_file_name`?ext=`file_ext`&ex=`expire_date`&is=`issued_on`&hm=`check_sum`
* `your_website_root_url`/ailabs/discord_cdn/media.discordapp.net/attachments/`channel`/`message`/`attachment_file_name`?ext=`file_ext`&ex=`expire_date`&is=`issued_on`&hm=`check_sum`

Example of [original](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1197013797467074673/1236110641325019228/midjourneyjan2024_May_the_Force_be_with_you_ffc523b1-fe86-46be-b5e0-6b3fcd3823ba.png?ex=6638cb7e&is=663779fe&hm=72c0e870df85e7db6cfc44c5027b5a426dc7e69036ef7ee2dcceab34d3d247af) attachment link (this link will likely expire by the time you read this) and [adjusted](https://privet.fun/ailabs/discord_cdn/cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1197013797467074673/1236110641325019228/midjourneyjan2024_May_the_Force_be_with_you_ffc523b1-fe86-46be-b5e0-6b3fcd3823ba?ext=png) Discord CDN smart proxy link (this link will be auto-refreshed by the Discord CDN smart proxy running at https://privet.fun).

Configuration steps:
* Create a new board user who will act as an AI placeholder bot, for our example we will use the user `DiscordCDN`. 
  Make sure this user account is **NOT** active as we only need this account as a placeholder.
* Go to `ACP` > `Extensions` > `AI Labs` > `Settings` and add new configuration, select `discord_cdn` from AI dropdown:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/discord_cdn_smart_proxy_setup.png) 
  - Use `Load default configuration/template` to get defaults.  
    Replace Configuration JSON `required_discord_token_a` with Discord token used by any of configured Discord AI bots or by any other active Discord token.  
    Optionally you can add more Discord tokens, see `optional_discord_token_b` and `optional_discord_token_c` or delete both `optional_discord_token_...` if you're not planing to use them.  
  - Update the `channels` array to include Discord channels from which you want to proxy Discord CDN attachment links. These should be the same Discord channels as the ones configured for your Discord AI bots and any other channels you optionally want to add. The `channels` array acts as a security measure to prevent third parties from using your proxy for their own needs.
  - Specify `ALL` for Quote or mention, this is not really used.

To verify that your setup is working ask the [Midjourney](#midjourney-setup) or any other configured Discord AI bot to generate something.   
Alternatively you can take a valid Discord CDN link and paste it to you browser as `your_website_root_url`/ailabs/discord_cdn/cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/`channel`/`message`/`attachment_file_name`?ext=`file_ext`, if Discord CDN smart proxy is configured properly it will refresh new then link and redirect your browser to that link.

If you had a version of this extension installed prior to v1.0.10, you likely already have expired Discord CDN links. Below are handy SQL statements to update your MySQL/MariaDB database to use the Discord CDN smart proxy link format. Run them one at a time and please make sure to take a backup before you make any changes.

To get rough idea how many posts will be affected:
```SQL
SELECT count(*)
FROM <you_prefix>_posts
WHERE post_text LIKE "%https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/%" OR post_text LIKE "%https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/%"
```

Update posts:
```SQL
UPDATE <you_prefix>_posts
SET post_text = REGEXP_REPLACE(post_text, 
                               'https://media\\.discordapp\\.net/attachments/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/([^.]+)\\.([A-Za-z0-9]+)(\\?ex=)?', 
                               '<your_website_root_url>/ailabs/discord_cdn/media.discordapp.net/attachments/\\1/\\2/\\3?ext=\\4&amp;ex=')
WHERE post_text LIKE "%https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/%"
```
```SQL
UPDATE <you_prefix>_posts
SET post_text = REGEXP_REPLACE(post_text, 
                               'https://cdn\\.discordapp\\.com/attachments/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/([^.]+)\\.([A-Za-z0-9]+)(\\?ex=)?', 
                               '<your_website_root_url>/ailabs/discord_cdn/cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/\\1/\\2/\\3?ext=\\4&amp;ex=')
WHERE post_text LIKE "%https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/%"
```

## ChatGPT setup 

* ✔️ ChatGPT [tutorial and examples](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=4528).

*  You will need OpenAI account, sign up at https://platform.openai.com/.  
   To obtain API key go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys, click on `Create new secret key`, copy and save in a safe place generated API key.  
   Open AI key starts with `sk-` and look something like this `sk-rb5yW9j6Nm2kP3Fhe7CPzT1QczwDZ5LvnlBfYU2EoqyX1dWs`.  

* Create new board user who will act as AI bot, for our example we will use user `ChatGPT`.  
  Make sure this user account is activated and fully functional.  

* Go to `ACP` > `Extensions` > `AI Labs` > `Settings` and add new configuration, select `chatgpt` from AI dropdown:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/chatgpt_setup.png)  
  
  - Use `Load default configuration/template` to get defaults.  
    Replace Configuration JSON `api-key` with your Open AI key.  
  - Select forums where you want `ChatGPT` AI user to reply to new posts and/or to quoted and [@mention](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/simple_mentions) (if you are using Simple mentions extension) posts. 

* Save changes, navigate to forum configured above and create new post (if you configured `Reply on a post`) or quote/[@mention]() `ChatGPT` user:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/chatgpt_example.png)

* Fine-tuning can be done by adjusting following OpenAI API chat parameters https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat
  - `model`, default `gpt-4o`, full list of models available at https://platform.openai.com/docs/models
  - `temperature`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` - see https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create

* Additional setting used by ChatGPT AI 
  - `max_tokens`, default 4096, define size reserved for AI reply when quoted.  
  - `prefix`, default empty, can be used to prompt model, see [ChatGPT advanced setup](#chatgpt-advanced-setup) for details.  
    👉 You can hint ChatGPT to format its responses using phpBB bbcodes markup by specifying `"prefix": "Use phpBB bbcode formatting when answering, unless explicitly specified otherwise."` and `"prefix_tokens": 21`.    
  - `prefix_tokens`, default 0, see [ChatGPT advanced setup](#chatgpt-advanced-setup) for details.    
  - `max_quote_length`, if provided, the quoted response text will be truncated to the number of words defined by the max_quote_length value. Set it to 0 to remove all quoted text entirely.  

## ChatGPT advanced setup 

You can setup ChatGPT to pretend it is somebody else using param `prefix` with custom prompt (aka system prompt).  
Let's create new board user `Bender` and configure it same as we did in [ChatGPT setup ](#chatgpt-setup).  
We want use `prefix` and `prefix_tokens` params to fine-tune ChatGPT AI behavior so our AI bot `Bender` will provide responses like [this](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=2799), mostly staying in a character.  
To determine what number should be placed in `prefix_tokens` let's ask our freshly created AI bot `Bender` question which we want to use for `prefix`.  
For example below we will use for `prefix` following system prompt `Pretend your are Bender from Futurma`  
![Request and response token count](../privet/ailabs/docs/chatgpt_setup_advanced.png)  
Once bot replied click on log icon, and note value of `Request tokens`.  
Finally go back to `Bender` AI bot configuration and update params `prefix` and `prefix_tokens`  
![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/chatgpt_bender_example.png)  

## Claude setup 

* ✔️ Claude [tutorial and examples](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=4527).

* Please follow the Anthropic [instructions](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/getting-access-to-claude) to create and activate a Claude API key.  
   Note the Claude API key you create, you will need it later to set up the Claude bot.  

* Create a new board user who will act as the AI bot. For our example, we will use the user `Claude`.  
  Ensure this user account is activated and fully functional.  

* Go to `ACP` > `Extensions` > `AI Labs` > `Settings` and add a new configuration, selecting `claude` from the AI dropdown:    
  ![](../privet/ailabs/docs/claude_setup.png)  
  
  - Use `Load default configuration/template` to load the defaults.  
    Replace `<API-KEY>` in the Configuration JSON with your Claude API key.  
  - Select the forums where you want the `Claude` AI user to reply to new posts and/or to quoted and [@mention](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/simple_mentions) posts (if you are using the Simple Mentions extension). 

* Save the changes, navigate to the forum configured above, and create a new post (if you configured `Reply on a post`) or quote/[@mention]() the `Claude` user to verify that it is working as expected. Refer to the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section if you encounter any issues.

* Fine-tuning can be achieved by adjusting the following Claude API configuration parameters:
  - `model` can be found here: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview#model-recommendations.
  - `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `system` can be found here: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post.
    Parameter `system` is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such as specifying a particular goal or role, see guide to [system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/system-prompts). If specified you will need to add number of tokens used by system prompt to `system_token` value to ensure correct token count. You can follow instructions for [ChatGPT advanced setup](#chatgpt-advanced-setup) to calculate `system_token` value.   
    👉 You can hint Claude to format its responses using phpBB bbcodes markup by specifying `"system": "Use phpBB bbcode formatting when answering, unless explicitly specified otherwise."` and `"system_tokens": 23`.     
    Users can override `temperature` parameter by providing a hint in the message using the `--temperature value` notation, e.g. `--temperature 0` or `--temperature 0.5` 

* Additional settings:
  - `max_quote_length`, if provided, the quoted response text will be truncated to the number of words defined by the `max_quote_length` value. Set it to 0 to remove all quoted text entirely. 

## Gemini setup 

* ✔️ Gemini [tutorial and examples](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=4525).

* Please follow the Google [instructions](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/rest_quickstart) to create and activate a Gemini API key in Google AI Studio.  
   Note the Gemini API key you create, you will need it later to set up the Gemini and Gemini Vision bots.  

* Create a new board user who will act as the AI bot, for our example, we will use the user `Gemini`.  
  Ensure this user account is activated and fully functional.  

* Go to `ACP` > `Extensions` > `AI Labs` > `Settings` and add a new configuration, selecting `gemini` from the AI dropdown:    
  ![](../privet/ailabs/docs/gemini_setup.png)  
  
  - Use `Load default configuration/template` to load the defaults.  
    Replace `<API-KEY>` in the Configuration JSON with your Gemini API key.    
    👉 You can hint Gemini to format its responses using phpBB bbcodes markup by specifying `"prefix": "Use phpBB bbcode formatting when answering, unless explicitly specified otherwise."`.    
  - Select the forums where you want the `Gemini` AI user to reply to new posts and/or to quoted and [@mention](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/simple_mentions) posts (if you are using the Simple Mentions extension). 

* Save the changes, navigate to the forum configured above, and create a new post (if you configured `Reply on a post`) or quote/[@mention]() the `Gemini` user to verify that it is working as expected. Refer to the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section if you encounter any issues.

* Fine-tuning can be achieved by adjusting the following Gemini API configuration parameters:
  - `model` can be found here: https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini#model-versions, `model` is part of `url_generateContent` and `url_countTokens`.
  - `temperature`, `topK`, `topP` can be found here: https://ai.google.dev/docs/concepts#model_parameters, these should be placed in the `generation_config` node.
    Users can override the above parameters by providing a hint in the message using the `--param value` notation, where `--param` is case-insensitive.
    E.g. `--temperature 0` or `--temperature 0.5 --topk 1 --topp 0.8` 

* Additional settings used by the Gemini API:
  - `max_tokens`, default 30720, this is the maximum size of the entire conversation.
  - `prefix`, default is empty, it can be used to prompt the model.  
  - `max_quote_length`, if provided, the quoted response text will be truncated to the number of words defined by the `max_quote_length` value. Set it to 0 to remove all quoted text entirely. 

For an examples of how to use Gemini bot please refer to [Gemini](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=4525).

## Gemini Vision setup 

✔️ Gemini Vision [tutorial and examples](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=4089).

The setup for Gemini Vision follows the same steps as the above-mentioned Gemini bot. You will need to create a separate board user, e.g. `GeminiVision` and select `gemini_vision` from the AI dropdown.

The Gemini Vision bot does not support conversations, you will need to provide a prompt along with an image every time. You can attach an image to the post or provide an image URL directly in the prompt. For an examples of how to use Gemini Vision bot please refer to [Gemini Vision](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=4089).

## Chat bots can share conversation history

AI chat bots (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude) can now access each other's conversation history and context (starting from version 1.0.10 of this extension).  
You can start chatting with one AI chat bot and later on in the conversation tag another bot(s).  
Tagged bots will automatically inherit the entire conversation history and context.  
Please see [example](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=4221).

## DALL-E setup 

✔️ DALL-E [tutorial and examples](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=4529).

Setup mostly the same as for ChatGPT above:  
![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/dalle_setup.png)    

Refer to https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create to learn more about `n` and `size` parameters.  
[Examples](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?p=355594)

## DALL-E advanced features

 * To generate an image of the desired size, you can specify one of the following sizes anywhere within the prompt, [example](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?p=355600#p355600):  
   - 1024x1024  
   - 512x512  
   - 256x256  

 * To create [variations](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create-variation) of the image simply post image url to the prompt, [example](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?p=355596#p355596)

## Stable Diffusion v3 setup 

* ✔️ Stable Diffusion v3 [tutorial and examples](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=4520).
 
*  You will need Stability AI account, follow official [instructions](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started) to create account and obtain API key.  

* Create a new board user who will act as the AI bot, for our example, we will use the user `Stable Diffusion v3`.  
  Ensure this user account is activated and fully functional.  

* Go to `ACP` > `Extensions` > `AI Labs` > `Settings` and add a new configuration, selecting `stablediffusion_v3` from the AI dropdown:    
  ![](../privet/ailabs/docs/stablediffusion_v3_setup.png)  
  
  - Use `Load default configuration/template` to load the defaults.  
    Replace `<API-KEY>` in the Configuration JSON with your Stability AI account API key.    
  - Select the forums where you want the `Stable Diffusion v3` AI user to reply to new posts and/or to quoted and [@mention](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/simple_mentions) posts (if you are using the Simple Mentions extension). 

* Save the changes, navigate to the forum configured above, and create a new post (if you configured `Reply on a post`) or quote/[@mention]() the `Stable Diffusion v3` user to verify that it is working as expected. Refer to the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section if you encounter any issues.  
  
## Stable Diffusion v2 setup 

* This section covers original Stable Diffusion v2 setup.
 
*  You will need Stability AI account, follow official [instructions](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started) to create account and obtain API key.  

* Create new board user, let's say `Stable Diffusion` and create configuration:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/stablediffusion_setup.png)     
  [Examples](https://privet.fun/viewtopic.php?t=2801)  

* Refer to https://api.stability.ai/docs#tag/v1generation/operation/textToImage to learn more about configuration JSON parameters.  

## Troubleshooting
* AI Labs extension maintains internal logs, you should have admin or moderator rights to see log icon  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/debugging_post_icon.png)  

  You can see entire AI communication history in the log:  
  ![Attachment settings](../privet/ailabs/docs/debugging_log.png)  
  If Log entry is empty it usually means that `/ailabs/*` or `/app.php/ailabs/*` routes blocked by one of phpBB extensions (eg <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/extension/login_required">Login Required</a>) and you will need to add `/ailabs/*` or `/app.php/ailabs/*` to extension whitelist.  
  You can examine Log `response` (JSON) to see details for AI response.  
  Please feel free to post your questions or concerns at https://github.com/privet-fun/phpbb_ailabs/issues.

* When setting up your bot, you will be able to test the bot URL by referring to the `Bot URL (test)` link below    
  ![](../privet/ailabs/docs/gemini_setup.png)  
  If you do not see the bot response `Processing job 0`, you will need to investigate what is preventing access to that URL, your web server logs will be good place to start.

* You can enable cURL communication logging by adding the `"debug": true` parameter to your bot configuration. The AI Labs extension uses cURL to communicate with AI APIs. By enabling logging, you should be able to see the entire data exchange between the extension and the AI APIs. Look for `/var/www/phpbb/curl_debug.txt` (or similar) for log content.
